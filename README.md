## The TicTacToe game

<p>This Java program is used to play the game of the Tic Tac Toe.</p>

<p>This is a project coming from a course in my JetBrain Academy Study Plan, where the
goal is to make this game with the Java Swing API.</p>

>Here are the basic functionality at the moment.
> - You can choose a difficulty to have a challenge!
> - The status of the game is print in real time.
> - There are a reset button to reset the game (you still have the same difficulty).

### Before the game started

> It asks the player what game level difficulty he wants.

### Futures ideas and functionalities

> - Have an IA to play with it!
> - Add a system of scores for a game to make multiple games

>   - Change the GUI for some elements
>   - Change the difficulty of the game dynamically
> - A reformat of colors and GUI.
### And also
> - Adding more OOP concepts
> - Adding automatic test to test completely this program.
